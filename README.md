# Count_Value
# Python While Loop - Incrementing a Count Variable Lab - Scratch Pad

'''
Coding Challenge:
While Loop - Print A Count Value - This Challenge is to write 
code that uses a while loop to print the value of a counter 
variable that starts at 0 and loops up to 10. It should 
print 0-9 and then on the tenth test quit out of the loop.

Expected Output:

  Starting While Loop - Print Count Variable
  0
  1
  2
  â€¦
  8
  9
  Ending While Loop

# Code Started Here:
def main():
    print("Starting While Loop - Print Count Variable")
    
    # Initialize the counter
    count = 0
    
    # Start the while loop
    while count < 10:
        print(count)  # Print the current value of count
        count += 1  # Increment the counter by 1
    
    print("Ending While Loop")

main()
